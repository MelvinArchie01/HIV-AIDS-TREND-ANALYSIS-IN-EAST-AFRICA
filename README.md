# HIV-AIDS-TREND-ANALYSIS-IN-EAST-AFRICA
Project Overview

HIV continues to be a major public health issue in Africa, with a particularly high burden in sub-Saharan regions. Despite advances in prevention and treatment, HIV remains a lifelong condition, underscoring the importance of continuous monitoring and analysis of its impact. Tracking data on people living with HIV helps identify infection trends, prepare healthcare systems, and address challenges such as stigma, inequality, and poverty. Beyond health, HIV also influences employment, healthcare costs, and overall economic stability, making data-driven interventions essential.

This project leverages World Health Organization (WHO) and World Bank datasets to analyze HIV trends, poverty indicators, and child mortality rates in Africa. The analysis explores correlations between HIV prevalence and multidimensional poverty, while also examining under-five and neonatal mortality trends within the East African Community (EAC).
ata Sources

HIV Data: WHO Global Observatory – People living with HIV at the country level (2000–2023).

Poverty Data: World Bank – Multidimensional poverty headcount ratio (income, education, electricity, sanitation, drinking water, etc.).

Child Mortality Data: UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation – Under-five and neonatal mortality rates.

Geospatial Data: Shapefiles from GADM for visualization.
Tasks
Question 1 – HIV & Poverty Analysis

Visualize the trend of HIV cases in countries contributing to 75% of the global burden.

Visualize HIV cases by WHO regions (using ParentLocationCode).

Merge WHO HIV data with World Bank multidimensional poverty data.

Analyze the relationship between HIV prevalence and poverty indicators, accounting for random effects (country, year).

Write a findings summary.

Question 2 – Child Mortality in East Africa

Filter mortality data for East African Community (EAC) member states.

Create country-level shapefile visualizations of the latest under-five and neonatal mortality estimates.

Plot average mortality trends over time, adding country-level estimates as points.

Identify the countries with the highest under-five and neonatal mortality rates in the region.

Deliverables
